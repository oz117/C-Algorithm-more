Get next line is a simple project returns the content of a file line by line.
It is a very simple project. This one is as optimised as I can do, there is:
    -only three functions
    -no memory leaks

In the .h file there is a macro that defines the size of the buffer, have fun
changing it to try different configurations.
By default the main tries to read the "gcc" document that is present in the
root of the project, it contains the whole gcc man.
